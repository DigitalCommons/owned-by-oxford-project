      <p>The organisations on our map are all working in their local areas to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.</p>
      <p>The solution to many of the economic and social issues in our lives can be addressed by putting more power and wealth in the hands of the people who best understand the strengths and needs of their own communities.</p>
      <p>This map is all about making these enterprising, community-led responses more visible. And increasing the collaboration and connections between them.</p>
      <p>If you work in an organisation that buys goods or services and want to make a difference in reducing inequality and empowering local people, this map provides a directory to help you find what you’re looking for from an organisation with guaranteed social and community purpose.</p>
      <p>If you are involved in or want to set up a community enterprise, then this map will help you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sell your goods and services.</li>
        <li>find partners to collaborate with.</li>
        <li>find organisations offering development support and training.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will be adding new organisations over time, so keep coming back if you can’t find what you’re looking for. And if you know an organisation that fits this profile that should be added let us know by getting in touch <a href="FIXME">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to use the map</h3>
      <p>If you click on <i>Directory</i> above you will find a list of categories to select from. Select a category and the map will show you all the organisations working in this field.Then click on the <i>pin</i> on the map to get more information about each organisation.</p>
      <p>The info box for each pin will tell you whether the organisation is a <i>Community Enterprise</i> or a <i>Support Organisation</i>.</p>
      <p>You can also use the <i>Search</i> function which gives you the options to choose from different filters or use a word search.</p>

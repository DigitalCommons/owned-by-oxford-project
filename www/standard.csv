The women are skilled cooks and put their hearts into making a variety of traditional dishes, presented with the hospitality prevalent in the culture of Syria, where many of them are from.
Together, they empower themselves and form a close-knit community that aims to empower other refugee women to make social connections, improve their language skills and develop their independence in the UK. The way to their new home was not paved with roses, but by supporting them each of us contributes to seeing the Damascus Rose in bloom again.

A Community Land Trust (a CLT) is an organisation set up to own and manage land by and for a local community. Through this organisation, the land is owned by the community in perpetuity and used for the explicit benefit of that community. It might be used for any purpose which benefits the community to which it is linked: housing, workspace, leisure or horticulture.

There are various legal structures which can underpin a CLT but one key aspect of the idea is that the land cannot be sold off for private gain.
